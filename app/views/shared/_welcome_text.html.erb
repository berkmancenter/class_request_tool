<p>
Class sessions at participating Harvard special collections libraries/archives can range from brief one hour surveys of collection materials chosen by faculty to reflect course themes, to sessions in which library/archive staff select material and prepare presentations with our wealth of primary resources (please note <a href="https://hcl.harvard.edu:8001/forms/requests/instruction.cfm" style="color: #777777;">general library instruction</a> is scheduled separately.)

This site provides an easy way to explore options for the object-based learning that special collection libraries and archives offer at Harvard. Creating an account will also allow you submit requests for class sessions, to communicate with staff and to revisit the details of your past classes. To request a class, select the library/archive you would like to work with. You will then be prompted to sign into your account, or to create one. Next, we will ask you to provide course details and give us a sense of your goals for the visit. Once you have submitted this form, staff will contact you directly and begin making arrangements. We look forward to working with you.
